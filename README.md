## ✍️ About me

- Apprentice for application development at DATEV in Nuremberg, Germany.
- Based in Fürth – right next door to Nuremberg.
- Backend focused: I enjoy building APIs and services that are easy to reason about and even easier to deploy.  
- Self‑employed since 2022 – I like to turn ideas into running services, not slide decks.  
- You can reach me at **[rainer@schnittert.com](mailto:rainer@schnittert.com)**.

## 🧪 What I like to build

- Service‑oriented backends with clear boundaries, strong typing and readable modules.  
- Authentication and authorization flows that are secure but still understandable.  
- Tooling around deployment, monitoring and developer experience – I prefer automation over manual steps.

## 🚀 Selected projects

### Vinto – solar sailing gadget
Solar powered sensor platform for wind and GPS with local storage and exports.  
Tech: C++ (ESP32), MQTT, local logging, data export for later analysis.

### Cofyndr – platform for startups, investors & talent
Multi‑tenant platform with payments, profiles and matching.  
Tech: NestJS, PostgreSQL, Stripe, Docker, GitHub Actions, Cloud Foundry.

### Schnittert Cloud – my homelab

Focus: reproducible infra‑as‑code, self‑hosted CI pipelines and automated backups.

### Side projects: PixShare, Droply, Excluify, Sniplyx
Small services around file sharing, privacy and short links.  
They are my playground to try new ideas and technologies in the real world.

## ⏱ What I'm doing now

- Improving Spring Boot and NestJS boilerplates for faster, cleaner service setups.  
- Experimenting with self‑hosted CI and monitoring on my homelab.  
- Learning more about clean architecture and modular monoliths in TypeScript backends.

## 🎯 Beyond code

- I like building things that run on their own – from sailing gadgets to home servers.  
- I enjoy turning vague ideas into something you can actually click, curl or ssh into.  
- Franconia based: Fürth & Nuremberg are my home base for work, coffee and side projects.
